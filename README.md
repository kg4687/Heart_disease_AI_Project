# Heart Disease Prediction Project

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction Project repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various demographic and clinical attributes.

## Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.

### Key Objectives

- Utilize a comprehensive dataset containing demographic details and clinical parameters.
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Train a logistic regression model to predict heart disease based on input features.
- Develop a prediction system that allows real-time assessment of heart disease risk.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and implementation.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing and array operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Toolkit for machine learning tasks including model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating visualizations and plots.
- **Seaborn**: Library for statistical data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive development and documentation of the project.
- **GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting platform.

## Project Structure

- **`heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete project code with detailed explanations.
- **`heart_disease_data.csv`**: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`heart_disease_trained_model.sav`**: Saved model file containing the trained logistic regression model.
- **`README.md`**: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
